#  Restaurant Ordering System in C++

##  Overview
The **Restaurant Ordering System** is a console-based application developed in **C++** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
It simulates a real-world restaurant workflow — from browsing menus and placing orders to generating a detailed bill with taxes.

This project demonstrates the use of:
- Classes and Structures  
- STL Containers (`vector`, `unordered_map`)  
- Input validation  
- Modular code organization

##  Features
 **Category-based Menu:** Separate Veg and Non-Veg sections  
 **Dynamic Ordering:** Add, remove, and update order quantities  
 **Cart Management:** View and edit your current order anytime  
 **Automated Billing:** Calculates subtotal, tax (10%), and final total  
 **Input Validation:** Ensures safe and user-friendly input handling  
 **Object-Oriented Design:** Clean, modular, and extendable code

##  Concepts Used
| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Classes & Objects** | Organized structure and functionality |
| **Vectors** | Store and iterate menu items efficiently |
| **Unordered Map** | Manage user orders (key-value pairs) |
| **Functions** | Modular approach for clarity |
| **Input Validation** | Prevents invalid or unexpected user inputs |
| **Formatting (iomanip)** | Used for clean, aligned console output |
